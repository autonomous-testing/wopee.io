## Article V: Measures Implemented to Secure the Personal Data Being Processed

1. The level of security measures implemented to secure the Personal
   Data being processed and their carriers or the multimedia
   environment in which the Personal Data are stored or processed shall
   be adequate to the nature of the Personal Data being processed and
   the level of possible interference with the rights of the data
   subject to which they relate.

2. Security measures are measures that serve to ensure
   confidentiality, i.e. to prevent the disclosure of or access to the
   Personal Data and their carriers to/by any persons outside the group
   of persons authorized to carry out processing operations with or
   otherwise handle the Personal Data. Security measures further
   include measures that serve to prevent unauthorized access to and

   appointing authorized persons and assigning competencies relating to
   the Personal Data being processed; the authorization and its degree
   shall depend on the person’s job position and the competencies
   assigned to such position, so that the person concerned is only able
   to handle such Personal Data as are necessary for the proper
   performance of his/her position. The same shall apply to determining
   the scope of the processing operations the person will be authorized
   to perform and the cases in which he/she may use its authorization.
   The ultimate purpose of the processing of Personal Data shall always
   be taken into account.

4. Proper security includes regular reviews of the effectiveness and
   adequacy of the security measures adopted, training of staff and
   persons who have been engaged in the processing of Personal Data or
   who are in contact with the processing information and information
   on the security of processing, and verification of their knowledge,
   correct understanding of the functioning of security rules and
   compliance with the measures and practices.

5. The Personal data controller is entitled to conduct, on a regular
   basis, either directly or through a third party, audits and
   inspections of compliance with the personal data processor’s
   obligations, including a verification of sufficiency of the measures
   implemented to ensure security and compliance with the measures and
   procedures by the processor's employees.

6. If, on the basis of a review/audit/inspection or other findings,
   the data controller brings to the attention of the data processor
   any irregularities regarding the performance of the processor’s
   obligations, the processor shall remedy the situation without undue
   delay. The processor will notify the controller of the remedy.

7. The provisions of this article shall also apply to ensuring
   security of the information on security of the Personal Data
   processing, accordingly

## Article VI: Other Measures Implemented to Secure the Personal Data Being Processed

1. The processor shall implement security measures on the basis of a
   proper assessment of risks, the likelihood of risks and their
   possible negative consequences for the rights and freedoms of the
   data subjects. The primary objective must be to eliminate the risks,
   minimize the risks where elimination is not possible, and eliminate
   or at least minimize possible negative consequences for the rights
   and freedoms of the data subjects where minimization of risk is not
   possible.

   the processing of Personal Data, whether within one Party or between
   the Parties or towards third parties (contractors, clients, public
   authorities, etc.), shall always be carried out in the most secure
   and discreet manner, so that no person other than the legitimate
   addressee can acquire knowledge of the content of the communication,
   including the transmitted Personal Data.

2. Personal data shall be transferred using a data box, an e-mail
   message, an electronic storage service or a postal services Provider
   or another similar method of physical delivery of the data carrier
   to the addressee (messenger service, etc.).

   provided services, e-mail communication will be the exclusive form
   of communication. In these cases, it is not possible to transfer
   Personal Data by phone or otherwise.

4. If it is not possible to use the data box, the data may be
   transferred using an e-mail or a postal services Provider or another
   similar method of physical delivery of the data carrier to the
   addressee (messenger service, etc.). In such cases, it is always
   necessary to identify the particular addressee and to use the
   receipt confirmation service, or the personal delivery option.

5. The transfer of Personal Data via an e-mail message is subject to
   proper security of the transferred Personal Data. Security means
   that the file being transferred will be at least compressed to the
   ZIP or similar file format, and encoded using a safe password. A
   safe password means a password with at least 8 characters containing
   both alphanumeric (uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers) and
   non-alphanumeric characters. The password must be agreed with the
   addressee in advance and transferred safely; the transfer of a
   password in an open email message is not considered safe; the same
   applies to password changes.

6. The responsible representatives of the Parties shall select a
   secure password and shall inform each other of the password in a
   discrete manner.

7. The transfer of Personal Data by phone may only be used in
   exceptional cases; the use of phone includes short text messages
   (SMS), multimedia messages (MMS) or mobile applications with similar
   functions. Personal data can only be provided by phone if: the
   identity of the caller has been securely verified, it is certain
   that no person other than the duly identified caller can attend the
   call, and if the data are transferred between the controller and the
   processor, between two controllers, or between the processor and a
   sub-processor, it is certain that the data are properly recorded. If
   data are transferred using an SMS, MMS, or an application with
   similar functions, the message shall be deleted immediately after
   the data have been properly recorded.

## Article VIII: Security Incident

1.  If the personal data processor becomes aware of a security
    incident, the processor shall immediately notify the incident to the
    personal data controller. The same applies if there are reasonable
