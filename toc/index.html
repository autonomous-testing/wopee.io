            97 224, registered in the Companies Register kept by the Municipal
            Court in Praha, Section C, Insert no. 379856 (hereinafter
            “<b>Provider</b>”) govern the use of the Wopee App and Wopee System
            (hereinafter “<b>Wopee platform</b>”), subscription to the Wopee App
            and contractual relationships established between the Provider on
            one side and its Clients on the other side on the basis of a
            contract entered into by and between the Parties (hereinafter “<b
              >Terms of Use</b
            >“).
          </p>

          <h4>1. Introductory Provisions</h4>
          <p>
            1.1 In accordance with Section 1751 of the Civil Code, these Terms
            of Use shall apply to contractual relationships being established
            between the Provider on one side and legal entities or individual
            entrepreneurs as clients on the other side regarding (i) the use of
            Wopee platform operated by Provider and (ii) Services to be provided
            by the Provider to Clients in connection with Wopee platform for a
            consideration agreed between the Parties. The Wopee platform is not
            intended for and cannot be used by consumers acting as Clients,
            unless these Terms of use state otherwise.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.2 These Terms of Use form an integral part of each contractual
            relationship established between the Provider and a Client (i.e. of
            each Contract in accordance with paragraph 3.1 below), whose subject
            matter is the provision of Services by the Provider to the Client
            under the Contract, unless explicitly otherwise agreed in specific
            contractual provisions. These Terms of Use shall be binding upon the
            Parties for the whole period of duration of the contractual
            relationship until all receivables that have arisen between the
            Provider and Client are settled in full. Any special regulation in
            variance with these Terms of Use, that might possibly be agreed
            between Provider and Client in writing, shall supersede and take
            precedence over these Terms of Use in relation to a specific
            business transaction and contractual relationship to the extent to
            which the regulation stipulated in these Terms of Use differs from
            the written agreement between Provider and Client. As regards to the
            rest, these Terms of Use shall apply.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.3 If any provision of these Terms of Use becomes invalid,
            ineffective or unenforceable, to whatever degree or extent, under
            the valid legal regulations, the validity, effectiveness,
            enforceability or another legal perfectness of the remainder of
            provisions shall not be affected thereby. Immediately after the
            existence of any of the above-mentioned facts has been ascertained,
            any such invalid, ineffective or unenforceable provision of the
            Terms of Use or a written agreement between the Provider and Client
            shall be replaced by a new wording of these Terms of Use or written
            agreement, containing new contents of the concerned provision. The
            same shall apply in the case of any legal gap.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.4 The Provider may change the Terms of Use following the execution
            of this Contract. The Provider shall notify the Client in writing of
            a change in the Terms of Use, such notification can be done also by
            way of email. If within 30 days following the delivery of the
            written notification (email) regarding the changes to the Terms of
            Use the Client fails to inform the Provider in writing that it does
            not agree with the new wording of the Terms of Use, the new wording
            of the Terms of Use shall become binding and shall replace the
            original Terms of Use upon the expiry of a specified time limit of
            30 days. If Client expresses its disapproval of the new wording of
            the Terms of Use in the prescribed manner, the Contract shall
            terminate on the last day of the contractual Term; the provisions of
            Clause 5.4 hereof shall not apply. All fees and any other payments
            made by the Client to the Provider before the termination of the
            Contract according to this provision will always be considered as
            payments made in accordance with the Contract and the Client shall
            no right to any refund.
          </p>
